### 🔄 Session Management
DIWA uses a structured session lifecycle to maintain continuity across different AI interactions.

**1. Starting a Session (`@start`)**
Always start your work by calling `start_session`. This retrieves the latest handoff note, pending tasks, and active blockers. It ensures you have the full context of what was done by previous agents.

**2. Progress Tracking (`@log`)**
Record significant technical insights or completion of sub-tasks during the session.

**3. Ending a Session (`@handoff`)**
When you are finished or need to stop, use `@handoff`.
- **Summary**: Concise recap of achievements.
- **Next Steps**: Tactical list for the person/agent picking up the work.
- **Active Files**: Priority list of files currently being modified.

This protocol prevents "context drift" and duplication of effort.
