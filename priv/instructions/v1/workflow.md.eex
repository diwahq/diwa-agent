### 🛠️ DIWA Development Workflow
Follow these standard patterns when building within the DIWA ecosystem:

**1. Fact Extraction (ACE)**
Use `run_context_scan` to automatically extract architectural facts from the codebase.

**2. Decision Recording**
Use `record_decision` for any non-obvious architecture or design choice. This populates the persistence layer for future rationalization.

**3. Conflict Resolution**
Regularly check `list_conflicts` (Patent #3) to ensure that your changes don't contradict existing project knowledge or requirements.

**4. Context Hygiene**
Keep memories focused and tagged appropriately. Use `prune_expired_memories` if you notice stale information cluttering the context.
