# Protocol: Strict Handoff Adherence

1.  **Context Loading**: At the start of a session, you MUST use the available MCP tools (specifically `mcp_diwa_get_active_handoff` if available, or by checking the latest context) to retrieve the latest project state and handoff notes.
2.  **Scope Restriction**: You are restricted to working ONLY on the items listed in the "Next Steps" or "Pending Tasks" of the most recent handoff note.
3.  **Exceptions**:
    *   **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter errors, crashes, or blockers while executing the next steps, you are permitted to investigate and fix them.
    *   **User Override**: If the user explicitly asks for a task outside the scope, you may proceed, but you should briefly acknowledge that this is a deviation from the handoff plan if it's a significant context switch.
